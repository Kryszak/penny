# Penny
Linux Tui MP3 player

This project was created as a personal goal to improve my Rust skills. 

## Why Penny?
Inspiration for the name comes from the [character](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Penny) which battle theme is good and feels misplaced in the same time. 

## Dev dependencies
For development on Linux OS, alsa development libraries needs to be installed.

### Fedora
```
dnf install alsa-lib-devel
```
### Arch Linux
```
pacman -S alsa-lib
```
### Ubuntu
```

```
