# Penny
Linux Tui MP3 player

## Why Penny?
This project was created as a personal goal to improve my Rust skills. For now, there are no plans for any heavy work on new features or improvements. 
 

## TODO
- Command line argument parsing (starting with setting log level and visibility with defaults - [Clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/)
- FFT audio spectrum analysis & display
- Add tests for modules
- Github actions pipeline for test running

## Possible new features
- Theme support
- Playlist functionality
- Fetching more song metadata from external API
- D-Bus integration (MPRIS)
